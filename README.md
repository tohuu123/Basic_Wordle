# Python Wordle Game

A classic word-guessing game built with Python and the Tkinter GUI library.

## 📖 About The Game

This project is a desktop implementation of the Wordle game. Players have six attempts to guess a secret five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides color-coded feedback:

* **🟩 Green:** The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
* **🟨 Yellow:** The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
* **⬜ Gray:** The letter is not in the word.

The game includes an on-screen keyboard that also updates with these colors, helping you track used and correctly-placed letters.

## ✨ Features

* Classic 5-letter, 6-turn Wordle gameplay.
* Simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
* Handles both mouse clicks on virtual keyboard and physical keyboard inputs.
* Validates guesses against a built-in dictionary to ensure only valid words are entered.
* "Play Again" option after winning or losing a round.
* Players could play multiple round in the game. 

## ⚙️ Requirements

* [Python >= 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Tkinter (This library is already included by default with most Python 3 installations.)
